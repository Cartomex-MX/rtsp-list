List of RTSP cameras

Why are there different files?
***************************

Years ago many (*cough* chinesium) manufacturers used different RTSP paths for different cameras.  Over the years this got better.  The 'cameras-list-long.csv' file contains a very long an exhaustive list of models:cameras relationship.

Now most manufacturers have whittled their RTSP paths down to a more manageable few, which is where the list 'cameras-list-short.csv' comes in to play.  We don't expect for 'cameras-list-long' to be updated going forward, but kept for reference.
